How to run program:
    Ensure you are in the src folder when attempting to run the program. Compile
    the program by running make. Once compiled, you may run the program by entering
    ./VotingSystem. The program will prompt for a filename, either cpl.csv or ir.csv, for example.
    Enter one of these files and the program will execute.

How to run tests:
    The framework was set up to test anything included into the test.cc file
    that is located in the testing directory. To test, include the file you want 
    to test within the test.cc file. You also need to add the .cc and .h file
    to the CMakeLists.txt, under the 'add executables' section. To run the 
    test, run make in the terminal while in the repo-Team5/Project2/testing directory. 
    Ensure you are in the testing folder of the project before you run make.
